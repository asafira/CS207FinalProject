All files are in the trunk directory and its sub-directories.

You may well have to customize the system.mk file to reflect the
compilers and lapack/blas libraries available on your system. The
default system.mk file works ok using the gnu compilers under OS X.

To build and run an example application:

cd trunk
make Maxwell2D
./bin/Maxwell2D

The defaults used for this simulation are described in:
trunk/Src/Examples2D/Maxwell2D/Maxwell2D_Driver.cpp

The main function is in:
trunk/Src/Examples2D/Maxwell2D/Maxwell2D_main.cpp

For other examples see options in Makefile.
